17 y/o working on random C++ and C projects in my free time.

Latest complete project: C++ mathematical calculator for algebra, analytical geometry, and other expressions. Features RPN conversion and custom evaluator with unary operators. (private because of certain miscommunications with the people the code was originally meant for)


Latest Planned Project: OpenGL and phys engine in CPP.

Other languages I know are:
Python (ugh)
JavaScript
Java
