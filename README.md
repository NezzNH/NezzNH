17 y/o working on random C++ and C projects in my free time.

Latest complete project: C++ mathematical calculator for algebra, analytical geometry, and other expressions. Features RPN conversion and custom evaluator with unary operators. (private because the code was severely disrespected and unshowed for the project that it was meant for, and the intention of the project organizers in high school is to reuse it in next years projects. not allowing that.)


Latest Planned Project: OpenGL and phys engine in CPP.

Other languages I know are:
Python (ugh)
JavaScript
Java
